description: Connect to external certificate authorities
---

Many organizations rely on external certificate authorities to meet compliance requirements, receive publicly
trusted certificates, or integrate with existing enterprise PKI systems. Konfigyr allows you to seamlessly connect
to external CAs, bringing them into a unified certificate management workflow.

Konfigyr attempts to abstract the complexity of each external CA provider, offering a consistent enrollment and
renewal interface regardless of backend. All certificates issued through external CAs are stored, tracked, and
managed through Konfigyr’s certificate inventory and lifecycle automation system. This makes it possible to
consolidate certificate governance across internal, cloud, and third-party CAs without modifying downstream systems.

## Supported external Certification Authorities

Konfigyr integrates with enterprise PKIs such as Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) and supports
ACME-compatible public CAs including Let’s Encrypt and DigiCert. These integrations enable automated issuance of
server certificates, device certificates, user certificates, and workload identities based on your existing CA
infrastructure or compliance mandates.
