description: Create a private CA hierarchy
---

A private Certificate Authority (CA) enables organizations to issue certificates for internal services, workloads,
and devices without relying on publicly trusted roots. Konfigyr provides a secure and fully managed environment for
operating a private PKI hierarchy that includes offline root authorities and online intermediate authorities.

This allows you to establish internal trust domains that align with your network architecture, environment boundaries,
organizational units, or application groups.

## How Konfigyr manages CAs

Konfigyr supports creating and managing root CAs, generating intermediate CAs, defining issuance policies, and
handling CA lifecycle tasks such as rotation and renewal. Root CA keys are stored offline or inside a hardware-backed
third-party KMS to ensure they remain non-exportable and only used during controlled key ceremonies. Intermediate
CA keys remain online but are always protected by the KMS, either as non-extractable asymmetric keys or as encrypted
key material wrapped under a dedicated Key Encryption Key (KEK).

Each CA is isolated per namespace to ensure strict separation of trust boundaries and prevent cross-tenant exposure.
