Certificate-related incidents, such as unexpected expirations or failed renewals, can cause major outages. Konfigyr
provides built-in alerting and event notifications to keep teams informed of critical lifecycle changes and potential issues.

Alerts are triggered for events such as upcoming expiration, failed issuance, failed deployment, revocation,
or unusual certificate activity. Users can receive notifications through email, webhook integrations, chat platforms,
or monitoring systems. These alerts help teams detect and resolve issues early, before they impact production systems.

Konfigyr also emits structured lifecycle events that can be consumed by automation tools or SIEM systems,
enabling organizations to build custom workflows or compliance checks around certificate health. With real-time
visibility into the certificate state, teams can maintain higher reliability and reduce the operational risk
associated with cryptographic assets.

### Certificate lifecycle events

The following events are emitted for each certificate:

 * Certificate issued
 * Certificate renewed
 * Certificate revoked
 * Certificate expiration warning
 * Certificate deployments

### Event transports

You can configure Konfigyr to send certificate lifecycle events to the following destinations:
 * Email
 * Webhook
 * Microsoft Teams
 * Slack
