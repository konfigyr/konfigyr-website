Certificate management is the end-to-end process of handling the lifecycle of X.509 certificates that provide
identity and encryption for services, devices, workloads, and users. At its core, certificate management ensures
that certificates are issued securely, deployed correctly, kept valid over time, and retired when no longer needed.
Without strong certificate management, organizations risk outages, security incidents, compliance failures,
and trust breaches.

Our approach to certificate management emphasizes automation, observability, and strong security guarantees.
This allows organizations to centralize their certificate operations, eliminate manual errors, and ensure consistent
trust across services and environments. Konfigyr provides a unified and automated certificate management system
designed for large-scale, multi-tenant, and dynamic environments.

## Certificate lifecycle

Certificates go through a series of stages during their lifetime, from their creation to their retirement.
This series of stages is often referred to as the **certificate lifecycle**. The names of these stages may vary
from vendor to vendor, but they typically include discovery, enrollment, deployment, renewal, revocation, and retirement.

### Discovery

Certificate discovery is the first step, enabling Konfigyr to identify certificates across infrastructure and import
them into the inventory whether they originate from Konfigyr’s private CAs, an external CA, or cloud certificate
managers.

Discovery is a process of identifying all certificates deployed across an organization's network and cloud platforms,
including those that may be unmanaged or forgotten. This provides complete visibility and helps prevent unexpected
outages or security gaps.

### Enrollment

Enrollment ensures that new certificates are issued through secure and standardized methods such as
API-based requests, **ACME** flows, or device-oriented protocols like **EST**.

Process can be summarized through the following steps:

* An entity (a person, server, application, or device) generates a unique cryptographic key pair.
* A [Certificate Signing Request (CSR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request) containing the
  public key and relevant identifying information
  (like domain name, organization details) is sent to Konfigyr to be signed by the Certificate Authority (CA).
* The Konfigyr PKI then performs identity verification to ensure the requester is legitimate before issuing the
  certificate.

This stage establishes initial trust, linking a verified identity to a specific public key.

### Deployment

Once issued, the certificate must be installed and correctly configured on the intended systems, such as web servers,
load balancers, or user devices, to enable secure communication and authentication.

The Deployment phase places certificates and private keys where they are needed, using integrations with Kubernetes,
service meshes, cloud key vaults, or direct download workflows for legacy environments.

### Renewals

Konfigyr continuously monitors certificate health and schedules renewals based on defined policies, CA rules,
and application requirements. Renewals can be performed silently in the background or with approval workflows,
depending on your governance controls. Once renewed, certificates can be deployed automatically to workloads,
pushed to external systems, or published through configured distribution channels.

### Revocation

Revocation workflows are also handled automatically through updated [CRLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list)
and [OCSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol) responders. This ensures that
compromised or misused certificates no longer pose a risk. Konfigyr maintains historical records for renewed,
replaced, or revoked certificates to support auditing and compliance verification.

### Retirement

The final stage where a certificate reaches the end of its useful life, either through expiration or revocation.
Konfigyr would securely remove the certificate from active systems, cleaning up expired certificates, and securely
delete any associated private keys to reduce the attack surface.
