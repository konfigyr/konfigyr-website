Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the foundation for establishing trust in distributed systems. It provides a
structured way to create, manage, distribute, and validate digital certificates and the cryptographic keys behind them.

PKI enables secure communication, authenticated identities, and encrypted data exchanges across applications, services,
devices, and users. In modern cloud and hybrid environments, PKI plays a critical role in compliance, zero-trust
security models, workload identity, and automation.

Konfigyr includes a fully integrated PKI system designed to help organizations operate secure internal certificate
authorities, manage X.509 certificates at scale, and automate their lifecycle across diverse infrastructure. It
provides a unified control plane for certificate issuance, renewal, revocation, inventory, and distribution,
while integrating seamlessly with existing identity, security, and cloud platforms.

### Explore the PKI Features

With Konfigyr PKI, you can model complex internal trust hierarchies, enforce certificate usage rules, and define the
allowed identity attributes for issued certificates. Konfigyr automatically publishes CRLs and OCSP responses for
revocation, and it maintains full auditability for all signing operations. This makes it possible to operate a
private PKI with strong security guarantees while minimizing operational overhead.
