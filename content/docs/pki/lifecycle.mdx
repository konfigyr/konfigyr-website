Managing certificates manually is error-prone and costly. Konfigyr automates the full certificate lifecycle,
from issuance to renewal and revocation, ensuring that certificates remain valid and compliant across all environments.
Automation reduces the risk of expired certificates, service disruptions, and security exposure.

Lifecycle automation turns certificate management into a predictable and stable process, giving teams confidence
that their infrastructure remains secure without constant manual intervention.

### Discovery

The process of identifying all certificates deployed across an organization's network and cloud platforms, including
those that may be unmanaged or forgotten. This provides complete visibility and helps prevent unexpected outages
or security gaps.

### Enrollment

Enrollment is the formal process of requesting a new certificate from a configured Certificate Authority (CA).

Process can be summarized through the following steps:

 * An entity (a person, server, application, or device) generates a unique cryptographic key pair.
 * A [Certificate Signing Request (CSR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request) containing the
public key and relevant identifying information
(like domain name, organization details) is sent to Konfigyr to be signed by the Certificate Authority (CA).
 * The Konfigyr PKI then performs identity verification to ensure the requester is legitimate before issuing the
certificate.

This stage establishes initial trust, linking a verified identity to a specific public key.

### Deployment

Once issued, the certificate is installed and correctly configured on the intended systems, such as web servers,
load balancers, or user devices, to enable secure communication and authentication.

### Renewals

Konfigyr continuously monitors certificate health and schedules renewals based on defined policies, CA rules,
and application requirements. Renewals can be performed silently in the background or with approval workflows,
depending on your governance controls. Once renewed, certificates can be deployed automatically to workloads,
pushed to external systems, or published through configured distribution channels.

### Revocation

Revocation workflows are also handled automatically through updated [CRLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list)
and [OCSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol) responders. This ensures that
compromised or misused certificates no longer pose a risk. Konfigyr maintains historical records for renewed,
replaced, or revoked certificates to support auditing and compliance verification.

### Retirement

The final stage where a certificate reaches the end of its useful life, either through expiration or revocation.
Konfigyr would securely remove the certificate from active systems, cleaning up expired certificates, and securely
delete any associated private keys to reduce the attack surface.
