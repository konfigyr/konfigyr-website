The Konfigyr Artifactory is the central system responsible for collecting, normalizing, indexing, and versioning
configuration metadata extracted from Spring Boot applications and libraries. It forms the backbone of Konfigyr's
type‑safe configuration experience by maintaining a unified, authoritative understanding of all configuration
properties published by services across an organization. From ingestion to provenance tracking and UI consumption,
the Artifactory ensures that configuration data is discoverable, consistent, validated, and historically traceable.

## Metadata Ingestion

The lifecycle of configuration metadata begins within the services and libraries themselves. Developers typically
annotate their configuration classes using Spring Boot’s `@ConfigurationProperties` or rely on auto‑configuration
libraries that ship with their own metadata. During each build, the Maven and Gradle plugins provided by Konfigyr
extract this metadata from the generated `spring-configuration-metadata.json` files. These files include property
names, types, default values, documentation entries, deprecation markers, and occasionally value hints.

The plugins augment this metadata by enriching it with JSON Schema definitions. This schema generation step is critical
because it translates raw configuration information into a precise structural description that can be validated,
introspected, and rendered by the Konfigyr UI. Each plugin bundles the extracted metadata, the corresponding artifact
identity, its version, and builds provenance information into an ingestion request, which is sent to the Konfigyr
Artifactory’s API.

## Processing and indexing metadata

Once metadata reaches the Artifactory, it is first stored as a pending release. A release represents a single ingestion
event. Release acts as the unit of work for the system’s internal processing pipeline. The Artifactory asynchronously
processes these pending releases by parsing the uploaded metadata, validating its structure, and ensuring that it
adheres to the constraints defined by the Konfigyr specification.

During this phase, the Artifactory performs deduplication and normalization. Property descriptors are compared across
previously processed versions of the same artifact to identify changes, additions, and removals. The Artifactory also
resolves type information and ensures that comparable data is stored in a canonical form that can be indexed efficiently.

When processing is complete, the release is marked as completed, and the artifact version becomes available to other
parts of the system. Failed ingestion attempts, whether caused by malformed metadata or internal validation errors,
are marked accordingly and recorded for auditing.

## Provenance tracking and historical awareness

A defining characteristic of the Konfigyr Artifactory is its emphasis on provenance. Every artifact version carries
contextual metadata that describes where it came from, how it was built, and which environment produced it.

The ingestion API accepts build information such as the commit hash, repository reference, CI pipeline identifier,
and timestamps associated with the build. These attributes allow architects and auditors to reason about configuration
lineage, trace error regressions, and maintain a complete understanding of how configuration evolved over time.

Provenance is not limited to source‑level metadata. The Artifactory models internal relationships such as which
artifact versions belong to a release, which manifests refer to those versions, and which services consume them.
This graph of relationships makes it possible to answer complex queries, such as identifying which services are
impacted by a deprecated configuration property or which dependency upgrade introduced a breaking change.

## Using Metadata for a Type‑Safe configuration experience

Once artifacts and their metadata are indexed, they become available to Konfigyr services that rely on accurate
configuration definitions. A service declares which artifact versions it depends on by publishing a manifest.
This manifest lists all libraries and internal modules the service uses, cross-referenced by their artifact coordinates
and versions. By resolving the manifest, the Artifactory aggregates all configuration properties from the declared
artifacts into a unified property catalogue.

This unified set of property descriptors is what powers the type-safe user interface. Each descriptor includes a
JSON Schema definition that fully describes the shape of the property: whether it is scalar, a list of complex objects,
a nested structure, or a dynamic map. The UI interprets this schema to render corresponding input components, validate
user input, prevent incompatible values, and provide context-sensitive help and hints.

When a user configures an application through the UI, Konfigyr validates the configuration against the schema before
persisting it. The exported configuration files, either YAML or Java properties format, are generated by transforming the
validated JSON structure using Spring Boot’s relaxed binding rules. This ensures that applications receive correctly
structured configuration files that are guaranteed to match the metadata published by their dependent artifacts.

## Closing remarks

The Artifactory is the foundation of Konfigyr’s configuration intelligence. Through its ingestion, processing, and
provenance tracking workflows, it enforces consistency and enables rich features such as type-safe editing, dependency
impact analysis, and historical auditing. By standardizing how configuration metadata flows from code through build
pipelines and into the centralized platform, it ensures that developers and architects share a common, reliable source
of truth for configuring Spring Boot applications.
