import { CardLink } from '@/components/docs/card';

Konfigyr is a configuration management platform built specifically for Spring Boot applications. It centralizes
application configuration, enforces consistency across environments, and provides an intuitive type-safe editing
experience based on Spring Boot’s property metadata. Its design eliminates config drift, improves developer ergonomics,
and introduces enterprise‑grade governance for configuration changes.

## Key Features

- Type-Safe UI powered by property metadata ingestion
- Multi-Tenant Architecture with namespaces and member roles
- Per‑Project Encryption ensuring strict data isolation
- Change Requests & Approvals for controlled configuration workflows
- Versioning & Audit Trails for compliance
- Dynamic Configuration Delivery for Spring Boot applications

## Who is Konfigyr For?

Konfigyr is built for:

- Spring Boot developers
- DevOps teams managing large microservice fleets
- Platform engineering teams maintaining configuration governance
- Enterprises that are in need of security, auditability, and strict environment isolation

## How can I use Konfigyr?

Konfigyr can be used in two ways:

- A SaaS platform for managing configurations across services and environments.
- An on‑premise solution for businesses requiring isolation, compliance, or tight security.

Both options provide the same core platform capabilities. The decision depends on your operational model,
trust boundaries, and compliance requirements. Our Cloud offering comes with built-in security and operational
guarantees, a self-hosted deployment gives you full control but also full responsibility for securing and
maintaining the system.

### Konfigyr Cloud

Konfigyr Cloud is our fully managed, production-ready platform available at https://app.konfigyr.com. It provides automatic
updates, high availability, and secure infrastructure management. For most teams, Konfigyr Cloud is the fastest way
to get started, removing the operational burden of running and maintaining the platform yourself.

Choose our cloud offering if:

- You prefer not to manage deployments, upgrades, or scaling
- You want a secure, enterprise-grade hosted service
- You need the simplest, lowest-overhead way to adopt Konfigyr

By default, Konfigyr Cloud is a secure multi-tenant environment. For enterprises with advanced compliance or
isolation requirements, dedicated cloud instances are available.

### Self-Hosted Konfigyr

Konfigyr can also be deployed directly into your own infrastructure. This option provides complete control over
deployment, data residency, and operational security. In this model, your team manages uptime, patching, monitoring,
and any required integrations.

Choose self-hosting if:

- You require full ownership of your data, security policies, and deployment model
- Your compliance framework mandates on-premise or self-managed systems
- You need to deeply integrate Konfigyr with internal tools or constrained environments

Konfigyr supports a variety of deployment methods, including Docker, Docker Compose, or Kubernetes.
