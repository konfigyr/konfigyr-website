Namespaces are the core building block of Konfigyr’s multi-tenant architecture, providing strict isolation
between organizations, teams, and projects. This section explains how Namespaces work, how members are managed,
and how access is controlled across the platform.

Konfigyr’s permission model is designed to be predictable, auditable, and secure, ensuring that configuration
data is always protected and that the right people have access to the right resources.

## What Is a Namespace?

A Namespace is the primary container of ownership within Konfigyr. Each Namespace represents an organization,
business unit, or team. All critical resources, projects, configuration properties, environments, members, and
billing settings exist inside a Namespace. It's the foundation enabling Konfigyr to operate as a secure multi-tenant platform.

A Namespace provides:

- **Data isolation**: No resource is shared across namespaces.
- **Security boundaries**: Keys, encryption, and permissions are separated.
- **Organizational structure**: Group related projects under one logical owner.
- **Centralized governance**: Apply security policies at the tenant level.

Each Namespace contains:

- Members (user accounts who belong to the Namespace)
- Roles assigned to each Member
- Services (Spring Boot applications managed in Konfigyr)
- Security Policies (IP restrictions, identity rules, etc.)
- Encryption Keysets
- Licensing & Billing (for SaaS users)
- Audit Records

## Members

A Member is a user who has been granted access to a Namespace. Members are invited by organization administrators and
must accept the invitation before accessing Namespace resources.

Member lifecycle:
- Invitation is sent by an admin.
- User authenticates using the IdP.
- User account is linked to the Namespace.
- A default or explicitly assigned role defines permissions.

### Roles & Access Levels

Konfigyr permissions system is based on a role-based access control (RBAC) model. The system allows you to define
roles and assign them to user accounts and OAuth applications. Each role has a set of permissions that define what
actions a member can perform. Konfigyr ships with a built-in set of roles:

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
  <Card title="Administrator">
    The highest level of privilege that grants full administrative access to manage Namespace settings, members,
    services, security policies, billing...
  </Card>

  <Card title="User">
    This is the default role for most users. It provides users with a read and write access to service configuration
    properties, create and manage change requests.
  </Card>
</div>

#### Service permissions

Additionally, Konfigyr provides service-level permissions within a Namespace to define additional restrictions
to environment-level permissions, approval workflows, or restricted access to production profiles This allows
us to define fine-grained access controls such as:

- Developers can edit only `dev` and `staging` environments
- Only Admins can approve `production` environment changes

## Encryption & Isolation

Namespaces also act as cryptographic boundaries. When they are created, they are assigned with a unique
Key Encryption Key (KEK). This key is used to secure the Data Encryption Keysets (DEKs) which encrypt
the data stored within the Namespace.

This ensures that compromise of one Namespace does not expose another as our keys cannot be reused across
tenants.
