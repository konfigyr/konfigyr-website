description: Contributing on the Konfigyr codebase
---

This guide provides an introduction for contributors who want to set up a local development environment for Konfigyr.
It explains the prerequisites, the repository structure, the local runtime architecture, and the workflow needed to
build, run, and extend the platform’s services. The goal is to make onboarding predictable and smooth, regardless
of whether a contributor is working on backend services, frontend components, plugins, or infrastructure integrations.

## Overview

Konfigyr is composed of several repositories:
- The [Konfigyr platform](https://github.com/konfigyr/konfigyr-platform) monorepo that contains the core
platform services:
    - Identity Provider
    - REST API
    - Frontend Application
- The [Konfigyr plugins](https://github.com/konfigyr/konfigyr-pluing) repository that contains plugins for popular
build tools:
    - Gradle
    - Maven - *planned*
- The [Konfigyr website and documentation](https://github.com/konfigyr/konfigyr-website) that powers these docs and
our online web presentation.
- The [Konfigyr artifactory SDK](https://github.com/konfigyr/konfigyr-artifactory) that defines the API for
interacting with the Konfigyr Artifactory instance.
- The [Konfigyr cryptography library](https://github.com/konfigyr/konfigyr-crypto) that provides cryptographic
utilities for Spring Boot applications.

## Prerequisites

Before contributing to Konfigyr, ensure that your local environment is prepared with the required toolchain.
Java is required for the backend services, the SDK, the cryptography module, and the Gradle/Maven plugins.

The Konfigyr ecosystem requires:

- Java 21 or newer, along with Gradle for building and testing.
- Frontend codebase requires Node.js and a package manager such as npm or pnpm.
- Docker is used for spinning up development dependencies such as PostgreSQL and Testcontainers.

## Bugs and issues

Bug reports help make Konfigyr a better experience for everyone. When you report a bug, a template will be created
automatically containing information we’d like to know. Before raising a new issue, please search existing ones to
make sure you’re not creating a duplicate.

## What to work on?

You can start by browsing through our list of issues or adding your own that improves on the platform experience.
Once you’ve decided on an issue, leave a comment and wait to get approved; this helps avoid multiple people working on
the same issue.

## Pull requests

For a good pull request, make it small and focused on a single task, write a clear title and detailed description that
includes context, guidance, and testing information, and always self-review and test it before submitting.

Ensure the PR adheres to the project's style guides and includes relevant tests. Finally, be responsive to comments
and proactively review others' PRs.
