Welcome to the official documentation for Konfigyr, the Spring Boot Configuration Hub. This guide will help you
understand what Konfigyr is, why it exists, and how to get started using or developing it.

## What is Konfigyr?

Konfigyr is a configuration management platform built specifically for Spring Boot applications. It centralizes
application configuration, enforces consistency across environments, and provides an intuitive type-safe editing
experience based on Spring Boot’s property metadata.

Konfigyr can be used as:

- A SaaS platform for managing configurations across services and environments.
- An on‑premise solution for businesses requiring isolation, compliance, or tight security.

Its design eliminates config drift, improves developer ergonomics, and introduces enterprise‑grade governance
for configuration changes.

## Key Features

- Type-Safe UI powered by property metadata ingestion
- Multi-Tenant Architecture with namespaces and member roles
- Per‑Project Encryption ensuring strict data isolation
- Change Requests & Approvals for controlled configuration workflows
- Versioning & Audit Trails for compliance
- Dynamic Configuration Delivery for Spring Boot applications

## How Konfigyr Works

Konfigyr consists of three core components:

  />
  <Card
    title="REST API"
    description="Stores configuration, enforces authorization, and processes metadata."
    icon={<WebhookIcon size="2rem" />}
  />
  <Card
    title="Frontend Application"
    description="Provides a developer-friendly interface for managing applications and configurations."
    icon={<PanelsTopLeftIcon size="2rem" />}
  />
</div>

These components work together to securely ingest, store, validate, and deliver application configurations.
